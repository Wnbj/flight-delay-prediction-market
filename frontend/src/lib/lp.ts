 * Valuing a liquidity position.

 * WHY THERE IS NO DIVERGENCE TERM HERE. In a spot AMM, impermanent loss is
 * measured against holding the two assets, and that benchmark moves. In a
 * binary market built from complete sets it does not: `d` collateral mints `d`
 * YES and `d` NO, which pay exactly `d` at settlement whichever side wins, and
 * `d` again on a void where each side is halved. Holding is worth `d`. Not
 * providing at all is worth `d`. So par IS the benchmark, and the provider's
 * entire result is `value - deposited`, which splits cleanly into what the
 * fees brought in and what the traders took out.

/**
 * A provider's slice of the pool while the market is still open.
 *
 * The pool holds `yesReserve` YES and `noReserve` NO. At the marginal price
 * `p = noReserve / (yes + no)` those are worth `p·Y + (1-p)·N`, which reduces
 * to the HARMONIC MEAN of the reserves, `2YN/(Y+N)`. That is not a rounding
 * artefact — it is the structural cost of quoting: a balanced pool marks at
 * its own depth, while a skewed one marks strictly below it, because the side
 * the market has moved away from is the side the pool is left holding.
 *
 * It is a mark, not a claim. Nothing is owed until settlement.

 * not to grant: fees inflate the reserves without minting shares, so a later
 * deposit buys proportionally fewer of them.
