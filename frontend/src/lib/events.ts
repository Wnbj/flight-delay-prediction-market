 * reader sees as one question is the noise this exists to remove.
 *
 * MEMBERSHIP IS DERIVED, NOT STORED. Markets on the same contract, over the
 * same asset, resolving at the same instant ARE the same question — the strike
 * is the only thing that differs, which is what makes a ladder a ladder. So no
 * contract change and no migration were needed, and every ladder ever created
 * groups itself, including ones made before this code existed.
