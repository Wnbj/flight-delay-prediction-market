/**
 * @title AmmMarket
 * @notice A binary prediction market priced by a constant-product automated
 *         market maker, instead of parimutuel pooling.
 *
 *  WHY THIS EXISTS ALONGSIDE ParimutuelMarket RATHER THAN REPLACING IT:
 *  in a parimutuel market you do not buy at a price, you join a pool. Your
 *  share of the pot is only fixed at settlement, so every later stake on your
 *  own side dilutes you — stake when the odds look good and they can be worse
 *  by the time the market closes, through nothing you did. Here, buying gives
 *  you a fixed number of shares, each redeemable for exactly one unit of
 *  collateral if you are right. Your price is whatever you paid per share, and
 *  nothing anyone does afterwards can change it. That is the whole difference,
 *  and it is a different product rather than a tuning of the old one.
 *
 *  HOW SOLVENCY IS GUARANTEED, not merely tested:
 *  collateral only ever enters by minting COMPLETE SETS — one unit in mints
 *  one YES and one NO. So at all times
 *
 *      totalYesShares == totalNoShares == collateral held for this market
 *
 *  and every share, wherever it sits, is backed by its own unit. Whichever
 *  side wins, the claims against the market are exactly the shares of that
 *  side, which is exactly the collateral. The AMM cannot be drained by a
 *  trade because trading only ever moves shares between the pool and a
 *  trader; it never mints a share without the unit behind it. The fuzz tests
 *  assert this invariant directly rather than sampling outcomes.
 *
 *  ANY NUMBER OF LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS. Depositing scales both reserves by a
 *  common factor, which is the only way to add depth without moving the price,
 *  and mints LP shares in proportion. Because the deposit mints complete sets
 *  while the pool can only absorb them in its own ratio, the depositor keeps
 *  the remainder as a real directional position — exactly as the market's
 *  creator does when they open away from even money. After settlement each
 *  provider withdraws `winningReserve * theirShares / totalShares`, floored,
 *  so the sum can never exceed what the pool holds.
 *
 *  A TRADING FEE IS RETAINED AS COMPLETE SETS. The fee never leaves as a
 *  separate balance to be accounted for; it simply stays in both reserves,
 *  which raises the constant product and therefore the value of every LP
 *  share. That makes fee accrual outcome-independent — whichever side wins,
 *  the winning reserve carries the fees with it — and it means a late
 *  provider mints fewer shares per unit deposited, so they cannot claim
 *  fees earned before they arrived. Both properties fall out of the
 *  arithmetic rather than needing a checkpoint mechanism.
 *
 *  Settlement is deliberately event-compatible with CryptoMarket, so the same
 *  CRE workflow handler settles both — this contract's address is simply added
 *  to that trigger's address list.
 *
 *  NOT AUDITED. POC only.

     *
     * OPENING AT A CHOSEN PRICE, rather than always at even money.
     *
     * The first version always split the minted sets evenly, so every market
     * opened at 50% whatever its strike. That is defensible for a lone market
     * — the maker takes no view — and useless for a strike ladder, where five
     * rungs all reading 50% say nothing about where the price will land. The
     * only way to give the ladder a shape was to trade every rung by hand,
     * which cost `L·(sqrt(p/(1-p)) - 1)` per rung and ran to more than the
     * liquidity itself on the far strikes.
     *
     * So the pool takes reserves in the ratio `y:n = (1-p):p`, scaled so the
     * larger side uses the whole seed, and the maker KEEPS the remainder of
     * the other side. That leftover is a real position: a maker who opens a
     * market at 85% ends up holding YES shares, which is exactly what having
     * that view means. They are not quoting for free.
     *
     * The invariant is untouched — every minted share is still accounted for,
     * either in the pool or in the maker's own balance — so
     * `totalYes == totalNo == collateral` continues to hold.
     *
     * @param feeBps taken on every trade and retained by the pool. Fixed here
     *               and never changeable afterwards: it is a term the trader
     *               read in the quote, so moving it under them would be a rug
